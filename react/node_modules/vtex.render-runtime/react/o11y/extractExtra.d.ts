/**
 * This method extracts keys from objects iteratively

 *
 * Sentry doesn't log all the keys from an object
 * when an error is captured, so we need to extract
 * the keys and values from the error object and
 * adapt them to the format required by Sentry ourselves
 * in order to make them indexable and searchable.
 *
 * This helps us aggregate and filter errors in Sentry by
 * dynamically generating keys.
